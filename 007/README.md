## 007 - Objects

PHP is an object-oriented programming language - that is, it constructs its code around the idea that objects in the real world can be modeled as sets of properties (data) and functions (actions that they can either take or have applied to them). To explore objects we're going to take the scripts that we made before and convert them so that they do pretty much the same thing, but with code that's structured a bit differently.

Also, I'm going to show you a new way to put your code up on Reclaim using the FTP program Filezilla.

One thing I do want to mention: objects are generally one of the concepts that cause some confusion when you're learning to program. It's not that they're super difficult, but (like databases) they can be unintuitive because they represent a different way of thinking and breaking down the world into parts. *Please* ask questions in Slack as you work through this week's material. I will try to be as responsive to questions as I can.

**Videos**

The files I ended up with after creating these videos are in the examples directory for you to look at.

- .htaccess and config secrets: <https://vimeo.com/144193706>
- Objects: <https://vimeo.com/144193708>

Filezilla: <https://filezilla-project.org/>
(Note: if you already use an FTP program and want to stick with that then you can, I'm just suggesting this as a free alternative.)

**Reading**
The MVC Pattern and PHP: http://www.sitepoint.com/the-mvc-pattern-and-php-1/
There is a link at the bottom of this to part 2 of the article. If you want to continue you can, but part 2 gets into more complexity than you'll really need to deal with in this course.

**Assignment**

Take the program that you wrote in the last assignment and identify the pieces that you think could be made into objects. Make classes for them and convert your code over to use those classes. Once everything is working, put all of the PHP files you create into your 007 folder and sync them to github. Also, modify this file (README.md) to add a link to your program on Reclaim.

This assignment is due on Friday November 6th at noon.
