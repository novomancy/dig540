## Unit 11 - Building an exhibit

This set of videos will show you how to turn the basic input/output scripts we created previously into an interactive exhibit that can be navigated using an object's metadata. I will again be using the album data as an example, in this to show you how to turn your fragmentary HTML output into a real HTML page and create links between lists of albums and individual albums.

**Videos**

The files I ended up with after creating these videos are in the examples directory for you to look at.

There is no specific assignment due this week; however, I do want you to be working on your final project and am happy to give you feedback on that or anything we've worked on until now. The final project is due Dec. 18.
