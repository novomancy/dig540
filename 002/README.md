## Unit 2 - Databases, Collections, and Exhibitions

Hi everyone! This week we're discussing some of the different aspects of information systems and their expressions by talking about what I mean when I say 'database', 'collection', and 'exhibition'. We're also going to start thinking about what it means for an information system to appropriately support different applications by looking at a particular data standard and the applications that have been built around it.

**GitHub**
No need to update your fork from the master this week as there are no files in GitHub that are part of the assignment.

**Videos**

(Yes, some of these videos look different than others. They were recorded at different times...just go with it! :)

- Databases, Collections, and Exhibitions: <https://vimeo.com/73813080>
- Basic Database Evaluation: <https://vimeo.com/73817851>
- On "Organizing Systems": <https://vimeo.com/138932261>
- Assignment: <https://vimeo.com/138932262>

**Reading**
I have provided an excerpt of text in a PDF in the #reference channel. If you have already taken DIG510 it may look familiar to you, but it's probably worth a quick refresh skim while keeping the context mentioned in the video above in mind. 

In addition, there are some other readings I'd like you to take a look at. The links below are not immediately applicable to anything techincal that we're doing in this course but do provide an idea of the scope and context of the material we're working with. 

*DAMS vs CMS*: <https://www.canto.com/blog/digital-asset-management/what-is-the-difference-between-dam-and-cms/>
This is advertising for a commercial consulting service but introduces the split between management and presentation that we'll be thinking about in this course.

*What do the Best Museum Websites All Do?*: <https://blog.cogapp.com/what-do-the-best-museum-websites-all-do-8d6727504605>
Again, this is basically an advertorial, but it's worth looking at to think through some of the design considerations they identify.

*5 Spectra for Speculative Knowledge Design*: <http://nowviskie.org/2017/5-spectra/>
A completely different take on design considerations in GLAM infrastructure. Both the types of issues should be considered for different reasons; I'm putting them together here so you can get an idea of the scope of concerns that you need to keep in mind when thinking about collections and exhibitions.


**Assignment**

I'd like you to look into some related data formats: cddb, freedb, and Gracenote. Find some applications that are built on these formats and consider what affordances and limitations are introduced by building an application that uses them. For instance, what values are embedded in the formats, and what applications may exist for a database of audio metadata that includes properties not described in them? Alternatively, what does the format and scope of the data in cddb (and friends) include that seems specific to a particular application, technology, or intention?

Do some background research on these formats and we'll have a discussion in the #discussion channel over the course of the next week.
