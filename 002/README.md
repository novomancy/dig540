## Week 2 - Databases, Collections, and Exhibitions

Hi everyone! This week we're discussing some of the different aspects of information systems and their expressions by talking about what I mean when I say 'database', 'collection', and 'exhibition'. We're also going to start thinking about what it means for an information system to appropriately support different applications by looking at a particular data standard and the applications that have been built around it.

**GitHub**
No need to update your fork from the master this week as there are no files in GitHub that are part of the assignment.

**Videos**

(Yes, some of these videos look different than others. They were recorded at different times...just go with it! :)

- Databases, Collections, and Exhibitions: <https://vimeo.com/73813080>
- Basic Database Evaluation: <https://vimeo.com/73817851>

**Reading**
I have provided an excerpt of text in a PDF in the #reference channel.

**Assignment**

I'd like you to look into some related data formats: cddb, freedb, and Gracenote. Find some applications that are built on these formats and consider what affordances and limitations are introduced by building an application that uses them. For instance, what values are embedded in the formats, and what applications may exist for a database of audio metadata that includes properties not described in them? Alternatively, what does the format and scope of the data in cddb (and friends) include that seems specific to a particular application, technology, or intention?

Do some background research on these formats and we'll have a discussion in the #discussion channel over the course of the next week.
