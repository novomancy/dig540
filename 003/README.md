## Unit 3 - Data and Sheets

Now that you've looked into the CDDB family of applications a bit I want to start looking at the data itself. This week we'll look at some examples of files in FreeDB and think about the limitations and affordances of transforming those data files into a common spreadsheet.

**GitHub**
No need to update your fork from the master this week as there are no files in GitHub that are part of the assignment.

**Assignment**

The assignment is described in the video. I want you to take the 20 sample records in the freedb_sample.zip file above and transfer the data in them into a [Google Sheet](http://sheets.google.com/). Google Sheets are freeâ€“all you need is a Google account to use them. Since the FreeDB file format isn't an exact match for the data model used in a spreadsheet you're going to have to make some decisions about how exactly the data is represented in you sheet. Once you're done, create a link to share your sheet with me (as demonstrated in the video) and send me that link in a Slack direct message.

This assignment is due by 11:59PM on 9/19.
