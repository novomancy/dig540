## Mythical Creatures Zoological Virtual Exhibition

A visitor hesitates over the mouse click as he rethinks his choice of mythical
hero avatars. He is uncertain his hero will successfully navigate the virtual
exhibition he is about to enter. He clicks.

Never fear! The creatures of myth and folklore cannot harm the hero avatar. Each
gallery is dedicated to creatures of similar origins and storyline; those who may
have walked together and fought one another. A cacophony of their sounds erupts from
the computer speakers as the visitor moves his avatar among the galleries.

The visitor’s eye widen in awe. He has only seen some of these creatures in his mind’s
eye, and others have been described in television and movies. The visitor can click on
a creature to read or watch its story, to hear its range of sounds, to watch it in action,
or to view its mate and/or offspring.

The exhibition will be accessible without need for an account or login, and without submitting
fees or viewing advertisements.
