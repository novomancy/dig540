Database Schema for Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) Album Collection

The Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) is a non-profit organization
whose mission is "nurturing, performing, and recording serious, original music."  Founded
in Chicago in 1965, the AACM is a collective of jazz musicians who have worked together to explore the boundaries of
the form.  These musicians have played together in various ensembles, performed each others works, and guested on each
others albums.

For AACM's 50th anniversary, a digital exhibition showcasing the collective's output will open to the public.
Of particular interest is highlighting the collaborations and partnerships between musicians.  In order to document
the relationships between these musicians, the database includes fields for lead and guest musicians
for each album.  A search for an individual artist would not only bring up results for that artist's
albums, but also those that the artist had played on as part of the ensemble.  In addition, the convention
on jazz records to list the instrumentation has been preserved with the inclusion of an instruments field,
which connects to tracks, albums, and musicians.

The following fields are part of an individual album's record:

alb_id: Unique key, automatically assigned in NNNN format.

alb_title: Exact name of album.  Use initial capitals and spaces between words.

alb_format: This field refers to the size of the physical original and must be chosen from one of the following:
10 inch EP, 12 inch LP, CD.

label_name: Exact name of label. Use initial capitals and spaces between words.

label_loc: Exact name of city where label is located.  Use City, State, Country format.

mus_lead: Exact name of lead credited artist.  Use initial capitals and spaces
between words.  This field is repeatable if more than one artist is credited as lead.

mus_guest: Exact name of artists who played on album but were not credited as lead.
 Use initial capitals and spaces between words. This field is repeatable for each
additional guest artist.

mus_years: Date range of musician's creative output, in YYYY-YYYY format.  If still active,
enter date as YYYY-present.

mus_origin: Exact name of musician's location of artistic activity.
Use City, State, Country format.  This field is repeatable if the musician had
significant activity in more than one city.

track_title: Exact name of track.  Use initial capitals and spaces between words. This field is
repeatable.

track_duration: Length of track in MM:SS format.  This field is repeatable.
