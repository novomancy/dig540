## DIG540: Digital Collections & Exhibitions

Syllabus v2.1, 3 credits

  ----------------------------------------------------------------

**Course Information**

-   Slack: <https://dig540-2020.slack.com>
-   Instructor: John Bell

**Course Description**

This course covers the technical means and social consequences of
assembling and sharing cultural data and artifacts. Topics include the
fundamentals of relational databases; a survey of collection management
packages and practices; and an introduction to the special concerns and
programming concepts necessary to customize off-the-shelf database
solutions for domain and content appropriateness.

**Course Goals**

Upon completing the course, students will have:

- Been shown a variety of the collection management packages in use across
the field.
- Learned the fundamental structure and logic behind relational databases.
- Been introduced to concepts used in the PHP language to customize a CMS.
- Used data transformation tools to migrate collection data between formats.
- Gained an appreciation for the special source concerns of working with
cultural data in an information system.

**Required Materials**

Readings will be provided for you throughout the semester. No specific
text is needed.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------

**Course Site**

There are two main areas where you’ll find material related to the
course: Slack, and GitHub.

Slack

The course will be held on Slack, a relatively new but popular player in
the online collaboration tool arena. We will be using, evaluating, and
experimenting with this environment throughout the semester. Slack
conversations take place in topical channels where messages are streamed
in chronological order; the channels we will be using are:

\#discussion - Where the majority of the class takes place, by which I
mean your interaction with the instructor and other students. Talk about
course videos, concepts, and other pertinent things here.

\#feedback - Your assignments will be discussed in \#feedback, by both
the instructor and other students. Yes, this means that a) other
students can see what you’ve done and b) other students can critique
what you’ve said or created. This is a good thing! Discussion is an
opportunity for learning, which everyone in the class is there to do.
Remember, if everyone was an expert who did the assignment perfectly the
first time there would be no point in taking the class.

Think of the difference between \#discussion and \#feedback as the
present vs. the past: \#discussion is for the topic of the moment,
whereas \#feedback is where you consolidate and crystalize what you
learn from doing your work. That said, don’t worry too much about what
goes in each, and certainly don’t let anxiety about where to put
something stop you from posting at all!

\#reference - Where I will be posting videos, occasional reading
materials, and assignments. There is nothing stopping other people from
posting here, but if you do so please make sure it is a useful reference
link. Responses and questions should be posted to \#discussion.

\#general - The first thing you see when you log in to Slack, it will be
used for high level announcements.

\#random - everything else you might want to talk to the class about.

GitHub

This course will use GitHub to distribute files, assignments, and even
this syllabus. You’ll also be turning your work in using GitHub. GitHub
is a site that is often used to manage and distributed open source
software. It’s built on top of Git, a version control tool that you’re
going to see a lot of if you hang around software development circles
much. More details on how we’re going to use this tool are in the first
week’s videos.

**Course Flow**

The course is broken up into a series of topics that consist of video
lectures, readings, and associated assignments. Nominally each topic
takes one week, though you should expect some variation based on the
complexity of the material in the topic (you'll notice that there are 
topics than weeks in the semester). New topics will begin on Wednesdays. 
For each topic you are expected to:

-   Watch all of the lectures and tutorials listed in the week’s
    introduction and read any assigned material.

-   Submit the assignment on GitHub (or as a link to another site
    or resource, as appropriate).

-   Participate in the ongoing discussions on Slack. It cannot be
    emphasized enough how important this is to successfully taking an
    online-only course. A significant part of what you get from the
    class will come in talking and listening to other students and the
    instructors as they discuss their own take on the material.

This course is designed to be completely asynchronous so there are no
specific times for meeting with other students or the instructor.

**Attendance Policy**

Attendance in an asynchronous online course is a somewhat nebulous
concept. While it is expected that you will accomplish all of the tasks
by their assigned deadlines, participation in the class' online
discussion is also critical to your success in the class and the
frequency and depth of your interactions with other students and the
instructor will be considered part of your “attendance” and thus part of
your grade. **If you for any reason think you may have an issue, either
on a specific day/week or overall, talk to us! It is much easier to make
accommodations ahead of time than after the fact.**

  ----------------------------------------------------------------

**University Policies**

1)  **Academic Honesty Statement:** Academic honesty is very important.
    It is dishonest to cheat on exams, to copy term papers, to submit
    papers written by another person, to fake experimental results, or
    to copy or reword parts of books or articles into your own papers
    without appropriately citing the source. Students committing or
    aiding in any of these violations may be given failing grades for an
    assignment or for an entire course, at the discretion of the
    instructor. In addition to any academic action taken by an
    instructor, these violations are also subject to action under the
    University of Maine Student Conduct Code. The maximum possible
    sanction under the student conduct code is dismissal from the
    University.

2)  **Students with disabilities statement:** If you have a disability 
    for which you may be requesting an accommodation, please contact 
    Student Accessibility Services, 121 East Annex, 581.2319, as early 
    as possible in the term. Students who have already been approved 
    for accommodations by SAS and have a current accommodation letter 
    should meet with me (the instructor of the course) privately as 
    soon as possible.

3)  **Course Schedule Disclaimer (Disruption Clause):** In the event of
    an extended disruption of normal classroom activities, the format
    for this course may be modified to enable its completion within its
    programmed time frame. In that event, you will be provided an
    addendum to the syllabus that will supersede this version.

4)  **Sexual Discrimination Reporting:** The University of Maine is
    committed to making campus a safe place for students. Because of
    this commitment, if you tell a teacher about an experience of
    **sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, relationship abuse
    (dating violence and domestic violence), sexual misconduct or any
    form of gender discrimination** involving members of the campus,
    **your teacher is required to report** this information to the
    campus Office of Sexual Assault & Violence Prevention or the Office
    of Equal Opportunity.

-    *If you want to talk in confidence* to someone about an
    experience of sexual discrimination, please contact these resources:

-   For *confidential resources on campus*: **Counseling Center:
    207-581-1392** or **Cutler Health Center: at 207-581-4000**.

-   For *confidential resources off campus*: **Rape Response Services:**
    1-800-310-0000 or **Spruce Run**: 1-800-863-9909.
    **Other resources:** The resources listed below can offer support
    but may have to report the incident to others who can help:

    For *support services on campus*: **Office of Sexual Assault &
    Violence Prevention: 207-581-1406**, **Office of Community
    Standards: 207-581-1409**, **University of Maine Police:
    207-581-4040 or 911**. Or see the OSAVP website for a complete list
    of services at <http://www.umaine.edu/osavp/>

  ----------------------------------------------------------------

**Participation**

If the only time you post a comment is when you're turning in an
assignment then you will have little opportunity to display your
understanding of the ideas being discussed and we will not have much
information to use when evaluating your success in the class. Ask
questions, throw in comments, and generally add to the discussion as
much as possible, *particularly* if you think you missed something or
you have a stupid question. Odds are other people are as confused as you
are.

As with all classes, it is expected that you will treat others with
respect. If you are repeatedly abusive toward your classmates you will
be moderated out of the conversation and it will be considered an
absence for purposes of the attendance policy.

**Grading**

With the exception of the final project, grading for your assignments is
weighted equally across each week of the class. Your final project will
count as 1/4 of your grade, as it largely occupies the final 1/4 of the
semester.

In most cases you will be allowed to submit your work more than once if 
you so desire. Since you are allowed to resubmit work you will generally
not be given an explicit grade on each assignment. If you want I can
provide a grade, but in general I'd rather have you focus on understanding
concepts and getting technology working than hitting a specific point 
mark when you decide whether or not to resubmit any given assignment. If 
you feel like you need to review or rework something you probably do; if
you don't feel that way and I don't tell you otherwise, you're probably fine.

Participation is a significant part of your grade. The more you add
thoughtful, insightful comments to the discussion the more both you and
other students will benefit. Note, though, that does not mean you need
to write a carefully considered treatise in order to contribute! Stream
environments like Slack work best with shorter, more back-and-forth
discussions. Questions are always welcome and should be asked publicly
so that everybody can see the answer unless there is a very good reason
to ask privately. In many cases you will be expected to look at and
critique other students’ work as an absolute minimum level of
participation.

This is a graduate level course and you are expected to perform
accordingly. Meeting the requirements in an average manner will result
in a "C" as the final grade. Better than average effort and execution
will result in a "B". An "A" is reserved for those students who
demonstrate exceptional creative development, application, innovation,
effort, and an in-depth understanding of process. Under normal
circumstances a C or lower grade cannot be used as a graduate student to
count towards completion of your certificate. Failure to complete any of
the required components of your grade with an average or better effort
will result in a "D" or an "F" as your final grade.

**Topics**

*Unit 1: Virtual Collections*

Collecting information on artifacts is only the first half of the
responsibility of cultural preservation and cataloging institutions;
they must also work to keep that information alive and share it with
researchers and the public. In a digital context, methods of sharing
data can range from an internal database made available to other
institutional staff to a public website designed for dissemination. This
unit looks at how different goals can be met by different types of
information systems. Students also examine the shift in control from
curator to viewer that attends the transition from physical to virtual
exhibitions.

*Unit 2: Database Structures*

Understanding how data is stored helps understand how the storage medium
and mechanism influences the representation of an artifact. This section
introduces concepts of how databases are structured and demonstrates a
common tool used in their creation and manipulation, the SQL language.

*Unit 3: Publishing Data on the Web*

Databases are rarely exposed directly to the Internet, and for most
people would be largely useless if they were. Intermediary languages
take on the role of formatting data for output and passing data input
from the interface to the database. This unit introduces PHP, one
language that is often used to manipulate web pages.

*Unit 4: Merging Data and Logic*

In order to be useful, web interfaces and databases need to be connected
together. This unit demonstrates some basic programming techniques that
are used to insert, access, and display database information on web
sites in the PHP.

*Unit 5: Scope and Planning*

The final unit will allow students to plan modifications to a collection management
system to meet the needs of their particular cultural information. While
off-the-shelf platforms are useful, many cultural collections come with
special concerns that must be respected and are not accounted for in
generalized data models. This section both highlights some of the
potential issues involved in dealing with cultural data and gives
students the opportunity to address those issues by adjusting the data
model and output of a collection management system.
