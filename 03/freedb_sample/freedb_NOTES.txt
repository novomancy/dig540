DELETED "PROCESSED BY" data since it was all the same
DELETED "PLAY ORDER" data since it was all blank and track numbers control the order of tracks played?
Not sure what TRACK FRAME OFFSETS are used for, so keeping for now. I think it's linked to DISCID unique info for track lengths, but not in seconds.
Genre categories = blues; classical; country; data (ISO9660 and other data CDs); folk; jazz; newage; reggae; rock (incl. funk, soul, rap, pop, industrial, metal, etc.); soundtrack	(movies, shows); misc	(others that do not fit the above categories)

Was tempted to separate disc data from track data (except for DISCID) into different sheets/tables, but didn't since I needed to move data around in some of the fields.
