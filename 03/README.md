## Unit 3 - Data and Sheets

Now that you've looked into the CDDB family of applications a bit I want to start looking at the data itself. We're going to begin working on how you pull apart collections of data on cultural heritage materials by taking the example of music as documented by CDDB/FreeDB. In later weeks, we'll improve upon the basic CDDB structure in the same way that its successor formats have. 

To begin, we'll look at some examples of files as they existed in FreeDB (essentially the CDDB format) and think about the limitations and affordances of transforming those data files into a common spreadsheet.

You can either update your fork from mine or download the freedb_sample.zip file from Slack.

**Assignment**

The assignment is described in the video. I want you to take the 20 sample records in the freedb_sample.zip file and transfer the data in them into a [Google Sheet](http://sheets.google.com/). Google Sheets are freeâ€“all you need is a Google account to use them and your maine.edu address doubles as a Google account. Since the FreeDB file format isn't an exact match for the data model used in a spreadsheet you're going to have to make some decisions about how exactly the data is represented in you sheet. Once you're done, create a link to share your sheet with me (as demonstrated in the video) and send me that link in a Slack direct message.

This assignment is due by 11:59PM on 9/23.
