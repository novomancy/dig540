## Mythical Creatures Zoological Virtual Exhibition v2.0 (DIG540: Ikeda)

A visitor hesitates over the mouse click as he rethinks his choice of mythical
hero avatars. He is uncertain his hero will successfully navigate the virtual
exhibition he is about to enter. He clicks.

Never fear! The creatures of myth, folklore and gaming cannot harm the hero avatar. Each
gallery is dedicated to creatures of similar origins and storylines; those who may
have walked together and may have fought one another. A cacophony of their sounds erupts from
the computer speakers as the visitor moves his avatar among the galleries.

The visitor’s eyes widen in awe. He can click on a creature to discover its story, 
to hear its range of sounds, to watch it in action, or to view its relationships.

The exhibition will be accessible without need for an account or login, and without submitting
fees or viewing advertisements.
