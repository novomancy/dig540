## Week 4 - Database Creation

These videos will introduce you to populating MySQL databases using phpMyAdmin. I'll also show you how to create a database on Reclaim hosting - if you chose to go with a different web host rather than sign up with Reclaim then your process may be different, but once you get into phpMyAdmin the process should be similar from there on.

MySQL is not trivial to learn - like the other language we'll use in the class, we could easily fill the semester talking about it so you shouldn't expect to know all the options and implications of the buttons you see in phpMyAdmin. We'll go into a bit more depth as we continue through the semester and I'm always happy to answer specific questions, but we're just going to focus on what you need to know to accomplish the tasks we're looking at, not try to expose you to the entire language. If you want suggestions on how to follow up in more depth I can point you towards good resources, just ask!

**Assignment**

I'd like you to first take another pass at your database schema and add some more optimizations to it based on the reaction videos and the feedback I'll give you on what you submitted previously. Make another diagram, update your text file, and put the new versions in the 004 folder just like you did before with 003.

Then, follow the directions in the videos to turn your schema into an actual database in phpMyAdmin and export a .sql file. Save that .sql file into the 004 directory as well and commit the entire directory to github.

Also, please ask questions and continue to give others feedback on their databases in Slack!

This assignment is due on Wednesday Oct 7 at noon.
