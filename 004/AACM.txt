Database Schema for Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) Vinyl Record Collection

The Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) is a non-profit organization
whose mission is "nurturing, performing, and recording serious, original music."  Founded
in Chicago in 1965, the AACM includes NN musicians who are or were active in the avant-garde
jazz arena.  Many of these musicians played together in various ensembles and guested on each
others albums.

This particular collection is made up of vinyl records from AACM musicians.  In order to document
the relationships between these musicians, the database includes fields for lead and guest musicians
for each album.  A search for an individual artist would not only bring up results for that artist's
albums, but also those that the artist had played on as part of the ensemble.  In addition, the convention
on jazz records to list the instrumentation has been preserved with the inclusion of an instruments field,
which connects to tracks, albums, and musicians.

The following fields are part of an individual album's record:

alb_id: Unique key, automatically assigned in NNNN format.

alb_title: Exact name of album.  Use initial capitals and spaces between words.

alb_format: For this collection of vinyl records, this field refers to the size
 of the physical original and must be chosen from one of the following:
7 inch single, 10 inch EP, 12 inch LP.

alb_date: Album's release date.  Enter as year YYYY or, if exact date is known, YYYY MM DD.

label_name: Exact name of label. Use initial capitals and spaces between words.

label_loc: Exact name of city where label is located.  Use City, State, Country format.

mus_name: Exact name of artist.  Use initial capitals and spaces
between words.  This field is repeatable for each musician credited on a track.

mus_role: Enter either Lead, for lead credited musician(s), or Guest for all others.

mus_years: Date range of musician's creative output, in YYYY-YYYY format.  If still active,
enter date as YYYY-present.

mus_origin: Exact name of musician's location of artistic activity.
Use City, State, Country format.  This field is repeatable if the musician had
significant activity in more than one city.

track_title: Exact name of track.  Use initial capitals and spaces between words. This field is
repeatable.

track_duration: Length of track in MM:SS format.  This field is repeatable.

ins_name: Exact name of instrument as listed on album notes.  Use initial capitals and
spaces between words.
