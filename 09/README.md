## Unit 9 - Objects

PHP is an object-oriented programming language - that is, it constructs its code around the idea that objects in the real world can be modeled as sets of properties (data) and functions (actions that they can either take or have applied to them). To explore objects we're going to take the scripts that we made before and convert them so that they do pretty much the same thing, but with code that's structured a bit differently.

One thing I do want to mention: objects are generally one of the concepts that cause some confusion when you're learning to program. It's not that they're super difficult, but (like databases) they can be unintuitive because they represent a different way of thinking and breaking down the world into parts. *Please* ask questions in Slack as you work through this week's material. I will try to be as responsive to questions as I can.

**Videos**

The files I ended up with after creating these videos are in the examples directory for you to look at.

- PHP Objects 1: <https://vimeo.com/243183914>

**Assignment**

Take the class I created in these videos and add two functions to it. The first should set all of the data for a single album at once, and the second should print all the data for an album at once (as desccribed in the video). Then, modify the while and for loops in the current code where album data is set and printed to use your new functions. Once everything is working, put the PHP file you create into your 09 folder and sync it to github. Also, DM me a link to the URL on Reclaim where I can view your page.

This assignment is due during the week of Thanksgiving, whenever your family time allows you to get it in. We'll pick up again the following week.
