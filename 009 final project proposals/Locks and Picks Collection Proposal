Picking Locks and Picking Locks
Proposal by Araminta Matthews for DIG540 Omeka Collection
Submitted 11/28/2015


Background: I have several friends who work with network administration, security administration,
programming and coding, and web development, and there is a large swath of them who
entertain a passion for picking progressively harder locks. When I ask my friends what's the
appeal, they generally share the same response: "Picking a lock is like overcoming the security
measures within a program. The principles are the same. Knowing how they crack helps me to
ensure my programs are less vulnerable." Couple that with the vast number of homeowners I know,
each with a decent amount of property to protect, and we find that knowing what locks protect
what (and what it takes to "hack" them) can be beneficial both to the budding programmer and
to the property-protector.

Proposal: Drawing on the collection of locks held by this swath of programmer friends, I would
like to build an exhibit that demonstrates an image of the lock, the lock by name and price-point,
its consequent rating according to the proprietor of the brand, the rating from Underwriters
Laboratories (UL437), the picks necessary to pick the lock, and a user-rating to validate both
proprietary and UL437 rating systems. This collection will be built using Omeka's standard installation,
a few readily available plug-ins, and a custom-plug-in included below.

Theme: This exhibition will resemble a "character sheet" from a role-playing game. Each image of a
lock will be accompanied by its stats, "hit points," and the experience level necessary to
"defeat it."

Process (Standard Installation and Pre-Scripted Plug-ins):
1. Omeka Standard Installation
2. Plug-in: COMMENTING
    Users will be able to comment their experience with the lock, and/or ask questions
3. Plug-in: YOUTUBE IMPORT:
    Users will be able to connect to a Youtube video of the lock being picked
