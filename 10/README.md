## Unit 10 - PDO

PDO is the connector that allows your PHP scripts to talk to a database. In this unit we'll look at how to arrange your PHP scripts so that they're a bit easier to work with as they grow, how to configure PDO to work with your database, and then how to write data into and read data from your database. 

I will be working with the album data files as an example, and you are free to work along with the videos if you find it helpful. However, it's the time of year when final projects should be your first priority so please feel free to take the information in these videos and apply them to your final project design and development. I'm happy to answer questions on either the album data example or your final project.

**Videos**

The files I ended up with after creating these videos are in the examples directory for you to look at.

**Reference**

These videos use several functions that are built into PHP. There are a lot more of them out there and finding the specific function that does what you want to do can be difficult. The links below go to the PHP reference manual, which may or may not be useful because it's written in programmer-speak. Again, I'm happy to answer questions.

- PHP general language reference: <http://php.net/manual/en/langref.php>
- PDO class: <http://php.net/manual/en/class.pdo.php>
- PDOStatement class: <http://php.net/manual/en/class.pdostatement.php>

**Assignment**

There is no specific assignment due this week; however, I do want you to be working on your final project and am happy to give you feedback on that or anything we've worked on until now.
