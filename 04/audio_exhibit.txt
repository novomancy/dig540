DIG 540 - Week 4


I thought it would be interesting to focus on a data set of audio files from a poetry reading series.  I imagine a collection of files in MP3 format. 

This collection could be made available on a website, such as a university's English or Writing department site.  

UPenn's "PennSound" (https://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/about.php) is an example. 

This data could be used to create a digital exhibition on the site that's a retrospective of the reading series.  Ideally, the data on these events would be searchable.

I imagine this department holding three events per year (fall, spring, summer), and the audio files spanning 10 years.  

Each event results in a MP3 that runs between 30-60 minutes containing numerous speakers. Speakers often recite poems written by other poets. 

Here are field specs for building a relational database about these audio files:

TABLES 

ENTITY: 
AudioFile 
ATTRIBUTES: 
FileID : system generated PK
FileLength : running time (in seconds)
FileDate : creation date (also date of recorded event)
ExtT : extended track information (if any)
EventID : foreign key that might make sense here

From this AudioFile table, I split out the one-to-many relationships. 

Each AudioFile can have more than one Speaker, Poet, and PoemTitle (1:many), but only one Event (1:1).

A lookup table (Event Appearances) seems necessary to help sort out many:many relationships of the Event table (i.e. each speaker can appear at more than one event; each event contains more than one speaker, etc)

ENTITY:
Speaker
ATTRIBUTES:
SpeakerID
SpeakerName
PoemTitle 
EventID 

ENTITY:
Poet
ATTRIBUTES:
PoetID 
PoetName 
PoetCountry 
EventID 

ENTITY:
PoemTitle 
ATTRIBUTES: 
PoemTitleID 
PoemTitle 
EventID 

ENTITY: 
Event 
ATTRIBUTES: 
EventID : 4 digit PK containing event season and year (e.g. sp04=Spring2004; fl07=Fall2007; su08=Summer2008) 
FileDate : creation date of file (also in AudioFile table aka date of recorded event) 

ENTITY:
Event Appearances (lookup table)
ATTRIBUTES:
SpeakerID
PoetID
PoemTitleID 
EventID 


Final Notes: 

I tried to open a few MP3 files in VSC; they were loaded with errors that made them unreadable. 
I hope to figure out how to open MP3 files in VSC or another program, to make sure I'm not missing fields.
"ExtT" is just a guess on my part that MP3 files contain Extended Track Info.
