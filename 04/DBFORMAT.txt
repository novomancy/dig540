Database entries must be in the US-ASCII, ISO-8859-1 (the 8-bit ASCII
extension also known as "Latin alphabet #1" or ISO-Latin-1) or UTF-8 (Unicode)
character set. Lines must always be terminated by a newline/linefeed
(ctrl-J, or 0Ah) character or a carriage return character (ctrl-M, or 0Dh)
followed by a newline/linefeed character. All lines in a database entry must
be less than or equal to 256 characters in length, including the terminating 
character(s). Database entries with lines that are longer will be considered
invalid. There must be no blank lines in a database entry.

Lines that begin with # are comments. Comments should appear only at the
top of the file before any keywords. Comments in the body of the file are
subject to removal when submitted for inclusion to the database. Comments
should consist only of characters in the set:

{ tab (09h); space (20h) through tilde (7Eh) inclusive }

Comments should be ignored by applications using the database file, with
several exceptions described below.

The beginning of the first line in a database entry should consist of the
string "# xmcd". This string identifies the file as an xmcd format CD
database file. More text can appear after the "xmcd", but is unnecessary.

The comments should also contain the string "# Track frame offsets:" followed
by the list of track offsets (the # of frames from the beginning of the CD)
obtained from the table of contents on the CD itself, with any amount of white
space between the "#" and the offset. There should be no other comments
interspersed between the list of track offsets. This list must follow the
initial identifier string described above. Following the offset list should
be at least one blank comment, even though database entries without such a
blank comment are also considered valid.

After the offset list, the following string should appear:

"# Disc length: N"

where the number of seconds in the CD's play length is substituted for "N".
The number of seconds should be computed by dividing the total number of
1/75th second frames in the CD by 75 and truncating any remainder. This number
may not be rounded. 
Any string, such as "seconds", may be appended to the line provided there's at
least one white space between the amount of seconds and the string. An
application must be able to parse the line correctly at all times.

Note for Windows programmers:

The disc length provided by the Windows MCI interface should not be used here.
Instead, the lead-out (address of the N+1th track) should be used. Since the
MCI interface does not provide the address of the lead-out, it should be
computed by adding the length of the last track to the offset of the last
track and truncating (not rounding) any remaining fraction of a second. Note
that the MCI interface yields an incorrect track offset which must be
corrected by adding one frame to the total frame count when performing the
disc length computation. For more information see the freedb.howto.

After the disc length, the following string should appear:

"# Revision: N"

where the database entry revision (decimal integer) is substituted for "N".

Files missing a revision are assumed to have a revision revision level of 0.
The revision is used for database management when comparing two entries in
order to determine which is the most recent. Client programs which allow the
user to modify a database entry should increment the revision when the user
submits a modified entry for inclusion in the database.

After the revision, the following string should appear:

"# Submitted via: client_name client_version optional_comments"

where the name of the client submitting the entry is substituted for
"client_name", the version of the client is substituted for "client_version",
and "optional_comments" is any sequence of legal characters. Clients which
allow users to modify database entries read from the database should update
this string with their own information before submitting.

The "client_version" field has a very specific format which should be
observed:

[leading text]version_number[release type][level]

Where:

	Leading text: is any string which does not include numbers.
	Version number and level: is any (possibly) decimal-separated list of
	    positive numbers.
	Release type: is a string of the form:
	    alpha, a, beta, b, patchlevel, patch, pl

For example:

	release:2.35.1alpha7
	v4.0PL0
	2.4

The only required portion of the version field is the version number. The
other parts are optional, though it is strongly recommended that the release
type field be filled in if relevant. Strict version checking may be
applied by software which evaluates the submitter revision, so it is wise
to make it clear when a release is beta, etc.

Following the comments is the disc data. Each line of disc data consists
of the format "KEYWORD=data", where "KEYWORD" is a valid keyword as described
below and "data" is any string consisting of characters in the set:

{ space (20h) through tilde (7Eh) inclusive; no-break-space (A0h) through
  y-umlaut (FFh) inclusive }

or an UTF-8 encoded string.

Newlines (0Ah), tabs (09h) and backslashes (2Fh) may be represented by the
two-character sequences "\n", "\t" and "\\" respectively. Client programs must
translate these sequences to the appropriate characters when displaying
disc data.

All of the applicable keywords must be present in the file, though they may
have empty data except for the DISCID and DTITLE keywords. They must appear in
the file in the order shown below. Multiple occurrences of the same keyword
indicate that the data contained on those lines should be concatenated; this
applies to any of the textual fields.
Keywords with numeric data should not have a comma after the last number on
each line. Valid keywords are as follows:

DISCID: The data following this keyword should be a comma-separated list of
	8-byte disc IDs. The disc ID indicated by the track offsets in the
	comment section must appear somewhere in the list. Other disc IDs
	represent links to this database entry. Note that linking entries is
	now deprecated and should not be used by submitting programs! 
	The algorithm for generating the disc ID is described in the freedb.howto.

DTITLE: Technically, this may consist of any data, but by convention contains
	the artist and disc title (in that order) separated by a "/" with a
	single space on either side to separate it from the text. There may be 
	other "/" characters in the DTITLE, but not with space on both sides, 
	as that character sequence is exclusively reserved as delimiter of 
	artist and disc title! If the "/" is absent, it is implied that the 
	artist and disc title are the same, although in this case the name 
	should rather be specified twice, separated by the delimiter. 
	If the disc is a sampler containing titles of various artists, the disc 
	artist should be set to "Various" (without the quotes).

DYEAR:  This field contains the (4-digit) year, in which the CD was released. 
	It should be empty (not 0) if the user hasn't entered a year.

DGENRE: This field contains the exact genre of the disc in a textual form 
	(i.e. write the genre here and do not use e.g. simply the MP3 ID3V1 
	genre code). Please note that this genre is not limited to the 
	11 CDDB-genres. The Genre in this field should be capitalized, e.g. 
	"New Age" instead of "newage" or "new age".

TTITLEN:There must be one of these for each track in the CD. The track
	number should be substituted for the "N", starting with 0. This field
	should contain the title of the Nth track on the CD. If the disc is a 
	sampler and there are different artists for the track titles, the 
	track artist and the track title (in that order) should be separated
	by a "/" with a single space on either side to separate it from the text.

EXTD:	This field contains the "extended data" for the CD. This is intended
	to be used as a place for interesting information related to the CD,
	such as credits, et cetera. If there is more than one of these lines
	in the file, the data is concatenated. This allows for extended data
	of arbitrary length.

EXTTN:	This field contains the "extended track data" for track "N". There
	must be one of these for each track in the CD. The track number
	should be substituted for the "N", starting with 0. This field is
	intended to be used as a place for interesting information related to
	the Nth track, such as the author and other credits, or lyrics. If
	there is more than one of these lines in the file, the data is
	concatenated. This allows for extended data of arbitrary length.

PLAYORDER:
	This field contains a comma-separated list of track numbers which
	represent a programmed track play order. This field is generally
	stripped of data in non-local database entries. Applications that
	submit entries for addition to the main database should strip any data
	from this keyword (i.e. add an empty "PLAYORDER=" line).
