2. SELECT interviewee_name.* FROM interview_files WHERE genre = "personal interview"
Error message said "unknown table" 'interviewee_name" -- this where I am getting confused. It seems like you can only select tables and not fields.

3. SELECT `interviewee_name`* FROM `interview_files.` WHERE `interview_files_subject` = "9-11"
generated an error message saying that I had a syntax error. Strangely, when I directly copy and pasted the syntax error, it displayed all the notes associated with the interviews, so it was doing something.

4.SELECT interview_files.interviewee_name,subject.subject_label from interview_files, subject where interview_files.id = subject.subject_id
generated error message that said unknown column "subject.subject_id".
I am trying to generate a list of the interviewees and subjects associated with them with this query.

The query worked but could find no data.
