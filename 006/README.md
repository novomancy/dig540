## 006 - PHP

These videos will introduce you to PHP, the programming language that we're going to be using for the rest of the semester. PHP is used to tie together data - like we've been building into our MySQL databases - and presentation. We're mostly going to use it to run pre-written queries against our databases and format the output in HTML so that it's human readable. Later, though, we'll also look at how to integrate custom PHP with off the shelf solutions.

**Assignment**

For this assignment I just want you to put a working PHP script up in your Reclaim account. What it does is up to you. However, it should at least use:

- Variables
- A loop
- A form
- An operation on the data that is put into the form (using a handler)

This assignment is due on Wednesday Oct 28th at noon.
