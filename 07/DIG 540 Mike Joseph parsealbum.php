<?php 
 // This file is a PHP file.  It will be executed when you load 
 // it on a web server.
 
 //The goal of this PHP is to open a .csv file, read each line in it, and then render 
 //those lines out to the browser.
 
 //First let's open the file.  It is in the same directory as this .php file and is called albumlist
 
 //to do that we use a function called fopen
  
 $file_handle = fopen('./albumlist.csv', 'r'); 
 
 //$file_handle is a variable.  Right now that variable is pointing at the very beginning of albumlist.csv
 //Let's read the first line.
 
 $first_line = fgetcsv($file_handle);
 
  //$first_line now contains the first line of data from the file. In this case, we know that the first
  //line is a header row with column names in it.  Also, becasue we told PHP that this is csv file, it 
  //automatically separated out each item in the row into a data type called an array.  Arrays are a kind
  //of variable that can contain multiple pieces of data under the same variable name. You refer to 
  //individual itmes in the array with a numbered index that starts at 0. For instance, the first
  //in the $first_line array could be accessed by writing $first_line[0], the second item would be 
  //$first_line[1], etc. Let's do something with those headers.
  
    for($i=0; $i<count($first_line); $i++){ 
	// We're now inside a loop.  This loop will execute exactly as many times as there are items in the 
	//$first_line array and will keep track of the iteration we're on in the $i variable.  Therefore, 
	//no matter which iteration of the loop we're on, we can access the current item in the $first_line
	//array by writing $first_line[$i].  For now, let's print them out.
	
	//printing in this case, uses a function called 'print_r'.  I am going to give print_r a string of 
	//text that will combine with the value of the $first_line variable every time it iterates through
	//the loop.  Then I am taking another string ('<br>')on to the end of it -- that's an HTML tag that
	//indicates a line break. 
	
  print_r('Column header found:  '.$first_line[$i].'<br>');
}
	//While we could keep going and get every line of data individually, it's faster to get each line
	//in another loop. We'll usa a different type of loop this time:  a while loop.	
  while($data_row = fgetcsv($file_handle)){
	  
	  //This loop will execute as many times as there are rows in the csv file, beginning with the 
	  //second row (since we aready read the first row earlier). It will store each row in the 
	  //$data_row variable, which is an array like $first_line was.  Right now, let's just print 
	  //out each row with a little  bit of formating.
	  
	  //First, let's print out an introductory line for each album. By looking at the data file,
	  //we know that the first column is the number of the album.  Let's use that here.  I'll use another
	  //HTML tag, in this case the paragraph tag.  Unlike <br>, the <p> tag needs to wrap the text that 
	  //it turns into a paragraph so it begins with <p> and closes with </p>. I'll open the paragraph
	  //here and then close it at the end of the while loop below.
  print_r("<p> This is the #$data_row[0] album:<br>");
  
  	  //Now let's look through the rest of the data. Note that, since we're using $data_row[0]
  	  //above, we can start with $i at 1 in this loop.  I will also take advantage of the fact that 
  	  //$first_line has the same indexing as $data_row, so every iteration of the loop the 
  	  //header in $first_line($i)will correspond with data in $data_row[$i]
  
  for($i=1; $i<count($data_row);$i++){
	  
	  //Hey, this is a loop inside another loop! Yep, you can do that. 
	  
	  //Now, another thing we know about the data file is that it index 4 and 5 of each row 
	  //are genre and subgenre.  Those two fields are comma delimited lists that can contain 
	  //multiple items in one data slot.  We'll treat those a bit differently than the columns.
	  //To do so, we need to add a conditional statement to the code-- in this case, an if statement.
	  // We want one thing to happen when $i is 1, 2, or 3 and somehting else to happen if $i is 
	  //4 or 5.
	    
  if($i<4){
	  //$i starts at 1 and increses by 1 each loop, so $i can only be 1, 2 or 3 in this branch
	  //These data itmems are fine as is, so we can just print them out. 
  print_r("$first_line[$i]: $data_row[$i]<br>");
  
  
  } else{ 
	  //Since 1, 2, and 3 are handled above and the loop ends after 5, only 4 and 5 can go here
	  //These are the genre and subgenre fields.  Let's split them up based on the commas.
	  //The str_getcsv function is like the fgetcsv function, but instead of operating on a 
	  //file it splits up a string of text that's already in memory. We want it to split up
	  //the string that is stored in $data_row[$i].  $genres will be an array again, just like the
	  //result of fgetcsv was above.  (note that the variable name $genres below will contain both
	  //genre and subgenre data on different iterations of the loop!)
	      
      $genres= str_getcsv($data_row[$i]);
      
      //Now we need to do something with each genre.  Let's print each one out it it's own numbered 
      //line. We can do that with another nested loop (we're 3 levels deep now).  We can use another
      //for loop, but since $i is already keeping track of where we are in the $data_row array we
      //need to use a different variable name to keep track of where we are in $genres.  Let' use 
      //$j for that.
      for ($j=0; $j<count($genres);$j++){
	      
	     //We have a problem though. $j is starting at 0. Computers may count from 0, but humans
	     //typically don't.  Instead of printing out $j, let's print out $j+1 below.
	      
      print_r("$first_line[$i]#".($j+1)." is $genres[$j]<br>");
      }
   }
}
		//...and here's the closing </p> tag that I promised above
   print_r('</p>');    
}

	//Since we opened the file ath the begining of the script, we have to close it at the end. 
fclose($file_handle);
