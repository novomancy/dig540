## 009 - Looking at the bigger picture

This week we're going to start shifting our focus from code based assignments to designing final projects. Since everyone's final projects will be different, that means that the content of videos going forward is also going to change. I'm going to spend less time on details of code or implementation and more time talking about bigger concepts and trends in digital curation technologies. I'm also going to be giving you some milestones for your final projects - the assignments I give from here aren't going to be final deliverables so much as steps along the way to your final.

**Assignment**

Write a brief text file that describes a collection of cultural materials that you'd like to present in Omeka. After this description I'd like you to add two categories of data that are required to present the materials you're working with: one set of fields that can be handled by existing Omeka database concepts or Omeka plugins and one set of fields unique to your presentation that will require creating a new Omeka plugin. Add this text file to the 009 directory and sync it to Github so that I and other students can see it.

This assignment is due on Monday November 30th at noon.

Also, if you are still working on previous assignments then please go ahead and complete them. I'm happy to answer questions about them whenever I'm available.
