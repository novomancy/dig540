From the earliest days of organized soccer, fans have supported their clubs by singing songs during matches.  These soccer chants are often based on existing melodies with lyrics changed to pertain to the home club, rival, or events during the game.  Over time, these chants have been borrowed and modified from club to club.  Some are based on traditional songs (the Welsh hymn Cwm Rhondda is the basis for numerous popular chants, such as "You're not singing anymore,” "We can see you sneaking out,” and "I will never be a Blue”), while others are based on more recent popular music (Depeche Mode’s “Just Can’t Get Enough” has been adapted by fans of Celtic, Burnley, Sydney, and the Chicago Fire, among others).

This exhibit will explore the origins, evolution, and connections between soccer chants across the globe.  It will be built on a database that organizes the chants based on their melodies.  Using the existing Omeka content management system, each chant will have one record consisting of an audio recording, text of the lyrics, and metadata that documents the chant’s title, origin melody, soccer club, location, date, and related chants.  The exhibit, which will use the Exhibit Builder plugin, will allow users to track variations on chants in several ways.  Users can search for all chants based on a particular origin melody, or pertaining to a certain location, era, or club.  The Neatline plugin will visualize the history of each chant on dynamic maps that show where and when variations have formed.  Contributors can also add their own recordings to the database through the Contribution plugin and their comments on existing records through the Commenting plugin.

As the origin melody is the central method of organizing the chants, a plugin for melody identification will have to be developed.  This feature will be crucial in the initial database setup, but will also be a key component in user searches and contributions.
