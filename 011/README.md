## Unit 11 - Building an exhibit

This set of videos will show you how to turn the basic input/output scripts we created previously into an interactive exhibit that can be navigated using an object's metadata. I will again be using the album data as an example, in this to show you how to turn your fragmentary HTML output into a real HTML page and create links between lists of albums and individual albums.

**Videos**

The files I ended up with after creating these videos are in the examples directory for you to look at.
